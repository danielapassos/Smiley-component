## Configuration

### Props

| Prop | Type | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| `members` | `Member[]` | Array of team member objects | `[]` |
| `circleSize` | `number` | Size of circles in pixels | `150` |
| `spacing` | `number` | Space between circles in pixels | `18` |
| `backgroundColor` | `string` | Color of smiley faces | `#D0FF00` |

### Types

```typescript
interface Member {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  photo: string;
}
```

## Technical Details

### Animation System

The component uses a coordinated animation system where:
- Clicked circles rise and flip
- Adjacent circles move downward
- Movement intensity decreases with distance
- Spring physics create natural motion

Key animation code:
```typescript
const getYOffset = (index: number) => {
    if (activeIndex === null) return 0;
    const distance = Math.abs(index - activeIndex);
    
    if (distance === 0) return -20;     // Up
    if (distance === 1) return 15;      // Down
    if (distance === 2) return 5;       // Slight
    return 0;                           // Still
};
```

### Performance Considerations

- Uses CSS `backface-visibility` for smooth flips
- Implements `transform-style: preserve-3d` for proper 3D
- Optimizes images with Next.js Image component
- Manages state efficiently with React hooks
